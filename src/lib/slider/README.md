## Usage

### Setup

Importing the module:
```ts
 @NgModule({
    imports: [MdSliderModule.forRoot()],
    ...
 })
 export class MyAppModule { }
```

### Basic Usage

`md-slider` can be used on its own as a slider with a min of `0`, a max of `100`, and a step of `1`.

```html
<md-slider></md-slider>
```

### Slider with Minimum and Maximum Values

The min and max on a `md-slider` can be set to give a different range of values.
These can be set individually and do not need to both be set.

```html
<md-slider min="1" max="5"></md-slider>
```

### Disabled Slider

`md-slider` can be disabled so that the value cannot be changed and the thumb cannot be moved.

```html
<md-slider disabled></md-slider>
```

### Slider with Value

`md-slider` can have a value defined so that it starts at a specific value on the slider.

```html
<md-slider value="24"></md-slider>
```

### Slider with Step

`md-slider` can have the step defined which declares where the thumb can snap to.

```html
<md-slider step="5"></md-slider>
```

### Slider with Tick Interval

`md-slider` can have a tick interval set to a number or to `auto`.
`auto` will automatically draw tick marks on steps that are at least 30px apart and will always draw
tick marks at the beginning and end of the slider.
Setting `tick-interval` to a number will draw a tick mark at every `tick-interval` steps. An example
of this is a `tick-interval` of `3` with a `step` of `4` will draw tick marks at every `3` steps,
which is the same as every `12` values.

```html
<md-slider tick-interval="auto"></md-slider>
<md-slider tick-interval="3" step="4"></md-slider>
```
